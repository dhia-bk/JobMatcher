# JobMatcher

JobMatcher is an automated job-hunting application that scrapes job listings from multiple platforms (LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed), processes and cleans the data, and stores it in a PostgreSQL database. The system utilizes an NLP-based recommendation engine, which combines vector embeddings, BM25 search, and reciprocal rank fusion to provide personalized job recommendations based on user profiles.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB (optional for intermediate storage)

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dhia-bk/AI-Job-Hunter.git
   cd AI-Job-Hunter
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


3. Set up LinkedIn account in src/job_scraper/config.py
3. Set up PostgreSQL:
   - run Setup.py to set up and configure the PostgreSQL database.

4. (Optional) Configure MongoDB if you plan to use it for storing raw job data before cleaning.

## Usage

1. **Scrape Jobs**: 
   Run the main script to scrape job listings from LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and Indeed:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Process Data**: 
   The data cleaning and processing will automatically run after scraping. The cleaned data will be stored in the PostgreSQL database.

3. **Job Recommendation**:
   The job recommendation system combines vector embeddings, BM25 search, and reciprocal rank fusion to deliver personalized job suggestions based on user profiles.

## Data Flow

1. **Scraping**: Jobs are scraped from multiple sources using the scrapers in the `job_scraper/` folder.
2. **Cleaning & Processing**: The `DataProcessor.py` script cleans and preprocesses the scraped data, removing unwanted characters and standardizing the format.
3. **Database**: Cleaned data is stored in the PostgreSQL database. You can interact with the data using the `PostgresManager.py`.
4. **Recommendation**: The `Job_Matcher.py` script provides AI-driven job recommendations based on user input, leveraging vector embeddings, BM25, and reciprocal rank fusion to ensure personalized results.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Selenium**: For web scraping.
- **PostgreSQL**: For storing cleaned job data in a structured format.
- **MongoDB**: (Optional) Intermediate storage of raw scraped data.
- **NLP-Based Recommendation**: Uses vector embeddings, BM25 search, and reciprocal rank fusion to deliver personalized job recommendations.
- **Power BI**: For dashboard visualization of job data.
